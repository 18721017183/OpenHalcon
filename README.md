# OpenHalcon

## 1.Basic Concept
Halcon is great tools in Machine Vision. They provide a portable platform for engineer in worldwide. This project is aimed to 

* build up a opensource Halcon platform to further discuss Halcon's Algorithm and architecture, 
* to help engineer to understand more Machine vision background. 
* And help Halcon to improve product.

In current stage, this project don't have any commercial target.

The source code is came from author, it is not Halcon's product and also didn't come from Halcon. All source code is come from guess.

## 2. Language and Environment

We use  MS VS2015 to build this system. Original Halcon is written by C#, and also easy to immigrate to embedded system. Especially, most machine vision is target to production environment.

## 3. Plan

In first stage, I just plan to build up Halcon core system to help people understand algorithm. In second stage, I plan to build up Halcon IDE platform.
